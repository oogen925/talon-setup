Dear ---, 

I'm writing to you with regards to Samuel's  application for --- at your company. He interned for me from June 3 - August 2 the summer of 2024 at Cleo. A women-led nonprofit dedicated to climate education, advocacy, and engagement. 

One of the main projects that sam did in his time at Cleo was to create accompaniment documents to go along with a video training series we had for climate advocacy. In this he watched all of the trainings and was able to come up with inquisitively prompting questions to spark people's curiosity and start planning how they will be active in their community to be filled out while watching the training videos. In this he demonstrated his attentive and ingenuities qualities, along with the ability to pivot with advice.

Sam was a great addition to our team at Cleo thanks to his outgoing and engaging personality. This lends him very well to to interpersonal relationships. He is interested in learning a manner of new things and responds well to advice. Therefore, I strongly believe the same would be a fantastic addition to your company.
