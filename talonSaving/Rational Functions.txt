Rational Functions(quotient of two polynomials):

Horizontal Asymptote:

if(denominator and numerator==exponent weight):
    leading coefficient[1]/leading coefficient[2]=Asymptote
else:
    when(denominator weight>numerator weight)
        Asymptote=0
            remember {account for constants}
else:
    when(numerator weight>denominator)->polynomial long division
^note:when changing factored to standard form to look at weight get rid of all the constants and just look at the variables

Vertical Asymptote:
    solve for denominator=0
    if factorable... factor


Vocab:
reciprocal function-f(x)=1/x


not negative

numerator weight>denominator weight
    therefore slant
