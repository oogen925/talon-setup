Hi Dr. SCS,

I am almost on the highest medication level for mestinon now (currently taking two full pills a day one in morning and evening). This week I'm adding half a pill at the midday. And I'm wondering if I can start medication for MCAS because the post nasal drip and dry eyes are really bothering me.

Thanks, 
Sam



Hi Ashley,

 
This is Mr. Rob's email, the therapist from Florida that I mentioned I worked with. I'm not sure how you typically prefer to communicate with physical therapists, but I'm happy to use whatever method works best for you. So far, we have not discussed the intensive program in Maryland in depth. I was thinking that if you contact him, you could talk to him about the physical therapy-related aspects.

I don't know if you would prefer to have open communication now or if I should tell him about maryland before you two talk. Additionally, I'm not sure if this is common practice, but I would appreciate being CC'd on the email threads to stay informed.


Thanks, 
Sam
